This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage a list of products by adding new entries, displaying them in a table, updating existing entries, and deleting individual or all entries.

Key Features:

Create: Users can add new products by filling in fields like title, price, taxes, ads, discount, and category. 
If the "count" field is greater than one, multiple instances of the product will be created.

Read: The list of products is displayed in a table, showing details like title, price, and category. Users can also search for products by title or category.

Update: Users can update existing products, which will reflect in the table immediately.

Delete: Users can delete individual products or clear the entire list with a single click.

Local Storage: All data is stored in the browserâ€™s local storage, ensuring persistence even after the page is refreshed.
